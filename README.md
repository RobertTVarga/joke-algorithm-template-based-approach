# joke-algorithm-template-based-approach

A possible approach to write a joke making algorithm in modern C++ is to use a template-based method, where you define a set of joke structures and fill in the blanks with appropriate words or phrases. For example, you can use the following joke template:
I like my X like I like my Y, Z
where X and Y are nouns, and Z is an adjective or a phrase. Then, you can use a word embedding model or a word association database to find suitable candidates for X, Y, and Z, based on some criteria such as semantic similarity, phonetic similarity, or humor potential. You can also use some modern C++ features, such as designated initializers and class template argument deduction, to make the code more concise and readable. Here is a possible code snippet for this approach
